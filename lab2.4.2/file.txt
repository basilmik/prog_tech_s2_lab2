ONE of the few redeeming facets of instructors, I thought, is that 
occasionally they can be fooled. It was true when my mother taught me to read, it 
was true when my father tried to teach me to be a farmer, and it's true now when I'm 
learning magik. "You haven't been practicing!" 			Garkin's harsh 			admonishment 
interrupted my musings.
